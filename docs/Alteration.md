Alteration
----------

> Alteration governs magic involving _change_. Change means taking something that exists and modifying it or mutating it into something else. A magic spell used to increase a character’s Physique attribute would be an Alteration spell, as would one that converts a simple ﬂame into an exploding ﬁreball. Alteration could enhance, reduce, or restrict a character’s existing skills.

> Alteration must work with things that are _already there_. An Alteration spell can only modify existing characteristics. It could be used to change a person into a bat, but it would not give the person the ability to ﬂy; Conjuration would also be necessary to give the character the _Flight_ Special Ability, something he didn’t have before.

With a smile and a friendly gesture, the caster improves his [Charm](Persuasion.md#charm) skill by +4D for one minute. (If he has no Charm skill, add the bonus to appropriate applications of the [Persuasion](Persuasion.md) skill or [Confidence](Confidence.md) attribute.)
