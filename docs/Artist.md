------

> Making works of art, like paintings, music compositions, and dance choreographies. (_Fantasy_, __artist__)

> Creating and noticing false or altered documentation in various media (paper, electronic, plastic card, etc.), including counterfeiting, though tasks may require other skills to help detect or make the forgery. (_Adventure_, _Space_, __forgery__)

In *D6 Fantasy*, Artist noticeably omits "literary compositions" from its possible applications. A close reading of the rest of the skill list reveals Reading/Writing took over that responsibility. Therefore, Reading/Writing is considered in general a part of the Artist skill.

*D6 Fantasy* is missing the Forgery skill because expertise in written language is part of the Reading/Writing skill. For this reason as a general rule Forgery is considered an Artist talent that is spun off into its own skill for certain genres.

Of note is the fact that Forgery is an ancillary skill that explicitly states in its description that other skills are needed to detect or make a forgery. Artist seems like a natural fit for this "other skills", as does Reading/Writing. Overall there is a strong case for merging both skills into Artist.
