Attribute
---------

Attributes represent any ability for a character to interact with the game world in a quantifiable way. Gamemakers can include any number of attributes for players to spend points on at character creation.

A score of 3D in an attribute represents an average human aptitude in that attribute.

### Core Attributes

- [Coordination](Coordination.md)
- [Endurance](Endurance.md)
- [Reflexes](Reflexes.md)
- [Strength](Strength.md)

### Optional Attributes

- [Intellect](Intellect.md)
- [Knowledge](Knowledge.md)
- [Magic](Magic.md)

No Attribute

The OpenD6 System can operate without attributes by allowing the purchase of skills directly. A gamemaker may also opt out of including certain attributes while including essential aspects of those attributes. In these cases, its important to include a skill to operate as a replacement for the attribute. For example, all three of the genre books omit the Endurance attribute and include the Stamina skill to replace the essential aspects of Endurance.
