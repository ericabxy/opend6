Attribute
---------

Attributes represent any ability for a character to interact with the game world in a quantifiable way. Gamemakers can include any number of attributes for players to spend points on at character creation.

A score of 3D in an attribute represents an average human aptitude in that attribute.

No Attribute

The OpenD6 System can operate without attributes by allowing the purchase of skills directly. A gamemaker may also opt out of including certain attributes while including essential aspects of those attributes. In these cases, its important to include a skill to operate as a replacement for the attribute. For example, all three of the genre books omit the Endurance attribute and include the Stamina skill to replace the essential aspects of Endurance.
