Notes
-----

### System Book

The average attribute score is considered to be 3D, with an average result of 10-11 which can beat a difficulty of easy (6-10) to moderate (11-15).

Standard human characters can have a minimum of 2D in any attribute and a maximum of 4D. This can be adjusted for different species, such as giants having lower ranges in some attributes and higher ranges in others.

- Higher attribute ranges should be balanced by lower ones if such characters can only spend 3D per attribute.
