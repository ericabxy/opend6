Notes
-----

Con is the same as a skill called Bluff in *D6 Fantasy*, with minor differences
in wording. Disguise is covered by Con in *D6 Space*.

The Confidence attribute is known by alternate names, Presence and Charisma, in
<cite>D6 Adventure</cite>, <cite>D6 Fantasy</cite>. <cite>D6 Space</cite>
combines Confidence and Perception into one attribute. A close reading of the
optional attributes in *System Book Chapter 3* suggests Con could be a skill
governed by either Perception or Confidence.
