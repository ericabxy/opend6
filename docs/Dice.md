Dice
----

In order to interact with the game world, characters have a "die code" next to their [attributes](attribute.md) and [skills](skill.md). When it comes time to challenge their ability or expertise, players roll dice according to this die code to determine success or failure. The number to the left of the "D" indicates the number of six-sided dice to roll, and the number to the right of the plus "+" sign—if any—is added to the result. A die code of 3D is considered human average aptitude and can succeed at a Moderate difficulty challenge about half the time.

Pips
----

The number to the right of the plus sign is also known as "pips" and indicates how far the die code has advanced toward the next higher full die. Die code progression looks like this: 2D, 2D+1, 2D+2, 3D, 3D+1, 3D+2, 4D, 4D+1, 4D+2. Essentially each die in the die code consists of three pips, and at character creation dice can be distributed in full or broken down into pips.

Difficulty
----------

To succeed at a challenge, a roll result must meet or exceed a difficulty set by the gamemaker.
