Methodology
-----------

If a skill is omitted by at least one book, a close reading of all skill descriptions determines which skill covers the missing skill, and the covered skill is not included in this list.

The name used in majority (at least two of the three books) determines the skill name. The attribute used in majority determines the governing attribute. The following attributes are considered synonymous.

- Reflexes and Agility
- Strength and Physique
- Knowledge and Intellect
- Perception and Acumen
- Confidence, Presence, and Charisma
