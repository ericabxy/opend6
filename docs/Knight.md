Knight
------

__Usual Skills:__

__Role:__ The knight belongs to a group of people who hold the same objectives, morals, or code. Typically, any knight who betrays the code of her order will endure harsh punishment—from dishonor to exile to death. Many consider knights creatures of noble thought. Rather, they are creatures of order and logic—but only that logic proscribed by the group. Those who deviate from the "true" voice of logic must be silenced. In reality, knights appear noble depending on the perspective of the beholder—those who ascribe to the knight's beliefs find them noble and just, while other find them either strange, pompous, or a barrier to freedom of thought.
