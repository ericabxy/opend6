Marksmanship
============

_Fantasy_ is technically the most comprehensive form of this skill, because it has no other skills for handling weapons, so Marksmanship covers everything.

_Adventure_ splits this into modern weapons with guns and rocket launchers being covered by Marksmanship, while primitive weapons like bows and slings are covered by Missile Weapons.

_Space_ specifies further by categorizing mounted weapons under Gunnery. However, Gunnery is governed by the Mechanical attribute rather than Agility because it's closely related to machine and vehicle operation.

Firing a ranged weapon is an essential combat function of the Coordination attribute, making Marksmanship a core combat skill.
