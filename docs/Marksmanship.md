Marksmanship
------------

> Shooting any gun a person can carry, even if it requires a tripod setup to fire. Covers everything from small slug throwers to shoulder-launched rockets. (_Space_, __firearms__)

> Accurately firing weapons mounted on powered armor, vehicles, and spaceships, or within fortresses. (_D6 Space_, __gunnery__)

> Shooting any kind of mechanical device - such as a bow or sling - that projects missiles across a distance. (_Fantasy_, __marksmanship__)

> Shooting guns of any type. Covers everything from small slugthrowers to vehicle-mounted rockets. (_Adventure_, __marksmanship__)

> Firing unpowered ranged weapons. (_Adventure_, _Space_, __missile weapons__)

__Description:__ <q>Characters who engage in long-range combat may wish to increase their proficiency with missile weapons (bows, blowguns, pistols, rifles, blasters, flame-throwers, and so on).</q>

_Fantasy_ is technically the most comprehensive form of this skill, because it has no other skills for handling weapons, so Marksmanship covers everything.

_Adventure_ splits this into modern weapons with guns and rocket launchers being covered by Marksmanship, while primitive weapons like bows and slings are covered by Missile Weapons.

_Space_ specifies further by categorizing mounted weapons under Gunnery. However, Gunnery is governed by the Mechanical attribute rather than Agility because it's closely related to machine and vehicle operation.

Firing a ranged weapon is an essential combat function of the Coordination attribute, making Marksmanship a core combat skill.

> Like the &lt;_melee weapon_&gt;, each type of weapon requires different knowledge and muscle control, and therefore a character cannot apply her experience in one weapon to another. For example, a character highly skilled in the use of a rifle (die code of 8D+1) may have only limited knowledge of pistols (die code of 5D+2) and absolutely no experience in blowgun (default to Coordination die code of 4D).
