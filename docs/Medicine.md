Notes
-----

This skill is essentially the same across genres with marginally different
flavor text. All of the descriptions include treating "injuries",
understanding/applying "medical procedures", "diagnosing illnesses", and
"performing surgery". *D6 Space* adds cybernetic implants, suggesting Technical
refers to "technology" as well as "technique".

*D6 Space* does reserve repair of cybernetic implants for the Personal
Equipment Repair skill. Medicine can only install the cybernetic implants, not
repair them.
