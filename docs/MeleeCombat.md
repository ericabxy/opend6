### &lt;Melee Weapon&gt;

> Since each type of weapon requires different knowledge and muscle control, a character cannot apply her experience in one weapon to another. For example, a character highly skilled in the use of a sword (die code of 7D+2) may have only a limited knowledge of axes (die code of 4D+1) and absolutely no experience in club (default to Reflexes die code of 3D+2).
