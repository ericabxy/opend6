_D6 Space_ adds the ability to use a navigational computer, a skill imported from [Tech](Tech.md). Astrogation involves using stars as external reference points, so _Adventure_ and _Fantasy_ characters could use Navigation in the same way assuming they have a requisite understanding of [Tech or Devices](Tech.md).
