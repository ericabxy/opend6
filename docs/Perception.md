Perception
----------

> Sometimes a character may have the opportunity to notice something in his surroundings that might provide an important piece of information. For example, a character might spot a bulging pocket on an adversary, which may indicate the presence of a concealed weapon. The __Perception__ attribute covers such instances as well as those skills that require the ability to read the emotions or logical reasoning of another, like bargaining, commanding, or persuading.

__Alternate Names:__ Awareness, Cognition, <span title='Solar'>Observation</span>, Sense

__Note:__ In _D6 Fantasy_, the Acumen attribute replaces Perception.
