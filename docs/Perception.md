Perception
----------

> Sometimes a character may have the opportunity to notice something in his surroundings that might provide an important piece of information. For example, a character might spot a bulging pocket on an adversary, which may indicate the presence of a concealed weapon. The __Perception__ attribute covers such instances as well as those skills that require the ability to read the emotions or logical reasoning of another, like bargaining, commanding, or persuading.

### Cognition

Since most mental abilities rely on a person's perception (gaining knowledge, figuring things out, recognizing patterns, employing empathy), this attribute can be used as a catch-all if you only have room for one mental attribute in a game system. See [Cognition - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition).
