Piloting
--------

> Operating any kind of vehicle or powered armor traveling on or through the ground, a liquid medium, the air, or space. (_Adventure_, __piloting__)

> Flying air- or space-borne craft, from hovercraft and in-atmosphere fighters to transports and battleships. (_Space_, __piloting__)

__Based On:__ <span title='Space'>Mechanical</span>, <span title='Adventure'>Coordination</span>

### Charioteering

> Accelerating, steering, and decelerating chariots (in particular) or any kind of cart-and-animal vehicle. (_Fantasy_, __charioteering__)

Charioteering falls under Piloting in _Adventure_ and Vehicle Operation in _Space_.

### Exoskeleton Operation

> Using single-person conveyances with skills and abilities that substitute for (not augment) the character's own skills and abilities. This skill substitutes for the character's Agility and Strength skills when using the "suit." (_Space_, __exoskeleton operation__)

Exoskeleton Operation falls under the "powered armor" clause of Piloting in _Adventure_ and has no analog in _Fantasy_.

### Pilotry

> Operating any water-faring vehicle, including steering, applying the oars, or managing the sails. (_Fantasy_, __pilotry__)

Pilotry covers nautical vehicles and falls under Piloting in _Adventure_ and Vehicle Operation in _Space_.

### Pilot &lt;Vessel&gt;

### Vehicle Operation

> Operating non-flying vehicles traveling on or through the ground or a liquid medium. (_Space_, __vehicle operation__)

Vehicle Operation excludes aircraft and spacecraft. It is covered by Piloting in _Aventure_ and has no analog in _Fantasy_.

&lt;Vessel&gt; Piloting
-----------------------

__Alternate Names:__ Pilot &lt;Vessel&gt;

__Based On:__ Perception

__Description:__ A character must make a _piloting_ roll whenever he attempts to perform a stunt (see the "Vehicle Combat" chapter). Piloting a vehicle under normal circumstances does not require a roll. Types of vessels include starships, boats, hovercraft, and cars, trucks, and motorcycles (in which case the skill can be called driving).

Notes
-----

The _D6 Adventure_ skill Piloting has the broadest definition, covering every
possible vehicle be it air-, space-, land-, or water-craft. _D6 Space_ narrows
this skill to flying only air and space craft.

_D6 Space_ lumps into one type both ground and water vehicles with the skill
Vehicle Operation, while _D6 Fantasy_ splits them into exactly two catergories
with Charioteering and Pilotry respectively.

Exoskeleton Operation and Charioteering are similar to each other in that they
are both specific to their genre and time period. They are also both ground
vehicles (a bipedal suit is made for walking).

The governing attribute is always Coordination or Mechanical.
