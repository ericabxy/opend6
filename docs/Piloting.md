Notes
-----

The _D6 Adventure_ skill Piloting has the broadest definition, covering every
possible vehicle be it air-, space-, land-, or water-craft. _D6 Space_ narrows
this skill to flying only air and space craft.

_D6 Space_ lumps into one type both ground and water vehicles with the skill
Vehicle Operation, while _D6 Fantasy_ splits them into exactly two catergories
with Charioteering and Pilotry respectively.

Exoskeleton Operation and Charioteering are similar to each other in that they
are both specific to their genre and time period. They are also both ground
vehicles (a bipedal suit is made for walking).

The governing attribute is always Coordination or Mechanical.
