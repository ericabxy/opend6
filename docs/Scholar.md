Scholar
=======

> Understanding of aliens not of the character's own species and their physiology, customs, and history. (<cite>Space</cite>, __aliens__)

> Familiarity with astrographic features (planets, star systems, nebulae), and general knowledge of any civilized elements present (settlements, industry, government, orbital installations). (_Space_, __astrography__)

> Knowledge of and ability to use a bureaucracy's intricate procedures to gain information, and favors, or attain other goals. (_Space_, __bureaucracy__)

> Understanding of the manners, customs, and social expectations of different cultures, including one's own. (_Space_, __cultures__)

> This skill represents knowledge and/or education in areas not covered under any other skill[...]. This may be restricted to a specific field (represented by specializations) or a general knowledge of a wide range of subjects. It is used to remember details, rumors, tales, legends, theories, important people, and the like, as appropriate for the subject in question. However, the broader the category, the fewer the details that can be recalled. It covers what the character himself can recall. Having another skill as a specialization of the scholar skill means that the character knows the theories and history behind the skill but can't actually use it. Scholar can be useful with investigation to narrow a search for information. (_Adventure_, _Space_, _Fantasy_, __scholar__)

> Understanding of how law enforcement organizations, regulations, and personnel operate. (_Space_, __security regulations__)

> Familiarity with deploying military forces and maneuvering them to the best advantage. (_Space_, __tactics__)
