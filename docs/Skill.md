Skill
-----

A skill represents a character's level of expertise in a specific area; more narrowly defined than an [attribute](Attribute.md). For example, a character with good [Coordination](Coordination.md) could train to be an excellent shot with [Firearms](Markmanship.md#firearms). The [Genre System](GenreSystem.md) lists a comprehensive set of skills to consider when designing an OpenD6 game, and the [A la Carte System](AlacarteSystem.md) provides another source of skills to choose from.

A skill can be categorized as a character's _knowledge_ of how to apply an attribute to a specific situation. E.g. a character with good [Reflexes](Reflexes.md) (an attribute) could train to be excellent at [Riding](Riding.md) domesticated mounts (a skill). See [Skill - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill).

Players are usually afforded 7 skill dice to distribute among available skills. A skill starts at the same die code as its base attribute, and each die spent on it raises the code by one die. Dice can be split into pips just like with attributes.

Raising the die code of a skill costs more during character advancement than during character creation.
