System Book Skills
==================

The D6 *System Book* outlines a wide range of 48 individual skills. The Game Master is meant to draw from this list to create an appropriate skill set for the game setting, and add any extra skills that are needed. These skills are listed in this document under Core attributes and Optional attributes.

The Game Master is advised to start with the four "core attributes" and select "optional attributes" as needed to facilitate the skill set. However this is not strictly required. For instance, in place of the Endurance core attribute a "resist damage" skill can instead be provided.

Several "professions" are listed on pages 23-26 of *System Book*, each of which describes a skill set. These skills have been included among the main 48 skills below with a note referencing which professions listed it.
