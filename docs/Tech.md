__Note:__ In _D6 Space_, the Tech skill is replaced by five more specialized skills.

__Note:__ In _D6 Fantasy_, the Devices skill replaces Tech.

Tech represents an understanding of complex technologies. You can use, design, and even fix technologically advanced equipment and devices, but making or building anything requires additional skill in [Crafting](Crafting.md).

### Related Skills

The _automated technology_ family of skills—[Demolitions, Security, and Traps](Security.md)—probably belongs under the Tech umbrella.

Technology Level
----------------

The description in _D6 Adventure_ suggests that electronic equipment is omitted from the _D6 Fantasy_ skill description. This is likely a matter of tech level; a fantasy setting may have complex mechanical devices but few if any powered by electricity. Nevertheless, a _Fantasy_ character in a setting that includes electronics would still categorize such equipment under Devices.
