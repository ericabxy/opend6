Spirit
------

Although Spirit is an alternate name for Willpower, there is evidence in Chapter 4 that its a wholly different attribute instead. The entry for Meditiation suggests perhaps it was once the basis for a character's mental (or Psionic) powers. The entry for Theurgy suggests it is the Magic basis for identifying spells as they are cast. The Performer profession suggests it might be the basis for _Illusory Magic_ as a &lt;Creative Ability&gt;. 

No Attribute
