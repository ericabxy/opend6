Notes
-----

The Languages skill is identical in *D6 Adventure*, *D6 Space*. *D6 Fantasy*
splits the skill into verbal and written variants because in this setting,
literacy is not as common as in other genres. Speaking is the skill most
similar to Languages because it is common to learn to speak and the description
is analogous.
