Notes
-----

Across all three genre books, Security and Traps are clearly related. The
description for Security in *D6 Adventure*, *D6 Space* are identical.
*D6 Fantasy* has the similar skill Traps, but omits advanced electronics.
Demolition from *D6 Adventure*, *D6 Space* falls under the description of Traps
in *D6 Fantasy*.

Security is unfortunately named, as the word fails to encompass both Traps and
Demolition. The overarching theme seems to be *automated devices*, as security
and surveillence systems, traps, and explosive charges are all meant to be
operated remotely or automatically.
