Tech
----

> Using and designing complex mechanical equipment. Actually building items requires crafting. (_Fantasy_, __devices__)

> Using and designing (not making) complex mechanical or electronic equipment, such as programming and operating computers and manipulating communication devices. (_Adventure_, __tech__)

__Alternate Names:__ Tech, Devices

__Based On:__ Knowledge, Intellect

Tech represents an understanding of complex technologies. You can use, design, and even fix technologically advanced equipment and devices, but making or building anything requires additional skill in [Crafting](Crafting.md).

### Comm

> Effectively using communication devices and arrays. (_Space_, __comm__)

__Based On:__ <span title='Space'>Mechanical</span>

### Computer Operations

__Based On:__ Intellect, Knowledge, Technical

### Sensors

> Operating scanner arrays to gather information about one's surroundings. (_Space_, __sensors__)

### Shields

> Deploying and redirecting shields aboard vehicles. (_Space_, __shields__)

Computer Interface/Repair
-------------------------

> Programming, interfacing with, and fixing computer systems. (_Space_, __computer interface/repair__)

__Based On:__ <span title='Space'>Technical</span>

Robot Interface/Repair
----------------------

> Programming, interfacing with and fixing robots and their systems. (_Space_, __robot interface/repair__)

Technology Level
----------------

The description in _D6 Adventure_ suggests that electronic equipment is omitted from the _D6 Fantasy_ skill description. This is likely a matter of tech level; a fantasy setting may have complex mechanical devices but few if any powered by electricity. Nevertheless, a _Fantasy_ character in a setting that includes electronics would still categorize such equipment under Devices.

No Attribute
------------

Tech is a stand-in for the [Technical](Technical.md) attribute.

Notes
-----

The [Demolitions, Security, and Traps](Security.md) skill details technology of the _automation_ or _remote operation_ variety.
