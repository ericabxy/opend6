The project now documents all 13 character "attributes" defined in _System Book_.

## What is an Attribute?

Attributes represent general, very broadly-defined skills such as "physical strength" and "logical reasoning".

## Core Attributes

_System Book_ claims four attributes are "core" to the rules and required. You're encouraged to include all four of them at minimum and add any others as needed. The reason these attributes are essential is due to the combat system.

- [Coordination](/Coordination) determines a character's accuracy of aim with missile weapons and dexterity when manipulating objects.
- [Endurance](/Endurance) is rolled when a character needs to resist damage from an attack or other problems.
- [Reflexes](/Reflexes) determine a character's ability to dodge attacks and land a hit with a hand-to-hand weapon, as well as athletic and acrobatic abilities.
- [Strength](/Strength) is a character's physical power to lift objects and deal damage.

The genre books combine Endurance and Strength, essentially reducing the number of essential attributes to three. _D6 Space_ further consolidates Reflexes and Coordination in an ability called Agility.

## Optional Attributes

The rest of the attributes defined in _System Book_ can be included in a system as needed. Since the core attributes are all physically-based, in my opinion the only optional attribute that is _needed_ is [Perception](/Perception). Perception covers a character's ability to notice things, but can also apply to figuring things out, remembering, knowing how to do something, etc..
