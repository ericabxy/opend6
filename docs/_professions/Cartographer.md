Cartographer
------------

__Usual Skills:__ [Chart Constellation](Navigation.md#chart-constellation), [Cartography](Navigation.md#cartography), [Architecture](Scholar.md#architecture), [&lt;Creative Ability&gt; (Drawing)](CreativeAbility.md#drawing), [Urban Geography](Streetwise.md#urban-geography)

__Role:__ The cartographer has one purpose—to draw maps. These maps serve a variety of functions—as floor plans, directions to secret caches of treasure, or as political boundary markers. Many frontiersmen would pay well for such maps, and therefore, cartographers often join expeditions into unknown territory.
