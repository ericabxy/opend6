Corporealist/Biologist
----------------------

__Usual Skills:__ Identify Species, Healing, Library Use, Identify Poison, Diagnose Malaise, Anatomy, Organic Alchemy, Cellular Knowledge

__Role:__ Corporealists share the awe of anatomy that [necrologists](Necrologist.md) possess. But, unlike their counterparts, they believe in the sanctity of all life, regardless of kingdom, class, or species.

Corporealists study the inner-workings of living beings, learning their strengths as well as their weaknesses. They act as a resource to healers, providing them with detailed descriptions of the known effects of certain substances on living tissues. The corporealist also devotes a large amount of her time to the categorization of the various species that reside throughout the universe—and some have even begun the classification of creatures from beyond. To this end they join scouting and exploratory groups that delve into regions never before seen by humanity.
