__Role:__ Evocators pore over hundreds of spell in their lifetimes, selecting only those that have the power to cause great conflagrations or devastation. They personify the most volatile of wizards, sometimes casting their greatest magic on a whim. They believe their power prevents their untimely death, and as a result, have earned reputations as fearless warriors who can easily turn the tide of battle with the loosing of a single spell upon the enemy. Since evocators hold power as the pinnacle of life achievement, they typically master several weapons, providing them with another means to surprise their opponents.
