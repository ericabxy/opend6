-----------

__Role:__ The necrologist spends most of her time dissecting the bodies of any and all living beings, in an attempt to discover the inner workings of the tissues and fluids found in almost all creatures. More advanced research of the necrologist involves the genetic alteration of species to create new, more powerful creatures. Many view this work as an abomination of nature and most states have banned the practice of necrology, forcing these researchers into hiding.
