Theurist
--------

__Usual Skills:__

__Role:__ The theurist, unlike other spellcasters, typically learns no skills other than spells. She devotes her life to the understanding of magic and mystical forces of the univers. Not one spell will pass before her eyes what she does not immediately learn and master. She constantly seeks out those incantations that have eluded her, collecting and arsenal of spells and enchanted items. Late in their careers, theurists usually begin to craft their own magical devices.
