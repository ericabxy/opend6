__Role:__ Wanderers meander through the world (or the galaxy) with no destination. They take odd jobs for short periods of time to earn enough for food and shelter, but soon grow bored with the area and move on. Some wanderers have chosen this life for their love of adventure, vowing to see every great wonder of the world. Others simply cannot stand the sedentary life and enjoy wandering for its own sake.
