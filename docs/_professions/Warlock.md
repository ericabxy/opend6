__Role:__ The few warlocks that still exist in the world devote their lives to the acquisition of magical knowledge. They frequently summon demonic creatures, using them as sources of information, protectors, or lackeys. Warlocks typically have dark, somber personalities, shackling themselves to their laboratories for centuries.
