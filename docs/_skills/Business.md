Notes
-----

Business and Trading are essentially the same skill in each genre book with
marginally different flavor text. *D6 Fantasy* mentions exchange rates,
bartering, and sales in addition to the common "business practices", "monetary value", and "how to make money".

Each description refers to a different set of other skills it can complement. In *D6 Space*, Business only complements Bargain. In *D6 Adventure*, *D6 Fantasy*, Business complements Bluff/Con, Charm, and Persuasion.

Business is one of the skills who's description included "Knowledge of", "Comprehension of", "Understanding of", et cetera.
