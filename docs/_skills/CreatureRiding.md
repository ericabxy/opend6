__Time Required:__ 5 seconds

__Description:__ This skill measures a character's abilty to ride a living creature, whether is be a horse, a giant lizard, or even a dragon. Ridable mounts have an oneriness code that represents their level of resistance to being ridden. When a character first slips into the saddle as well as during events that may frighten the mount, she must make an opposed _«creature» riding_ vs. orneriness roll (the gamemaster makes the orneriness roll for the beast). If the character rolls the same or higher value, he maintains control of his mount. Refer to the following table to determine the result if the creature generates the higher total.

Orneriness &gt; beast riding by | Result
------------------------------- | ------
1--5                            | Beast stops and refuses to move for 5 seconds.
6--10                           | Beast stops and refuses to move for 10 seconds.
11--15                          | Beast bolts in a random direction for 1D rounds.
16+                             | Beast bucks rider. Rider must make an Easy (10) Reflexes roll to avoid being thrown off.
