__Time Required:__ Length of a game

__Description:__ A gambler knows how to play various games of chance, understands odds and spreads, and (sometimes) has the ability to _influence_ a game, especially those involving cards, dice, or wheels (or other elements that involve some amount of skill to win). A character who successfully cheats at a game can alter the outcome in favor of anyone involved, including (and especially) himself.

If a character attempts to cheat (no matter whether he is successful or not), allow all others involved in the game to make Perception rolls. Anyone who rolls higher than the character's gambling total (the one he made to determine whether he successfully cheated) notices the character's efforts to alter the game's outcome.
