__Time Required:__ Varies

__Description:__ Doctors, medics, nurses, and other medically trained personnel use various techniques, medicines, and drugs to help cure the sick or injured of their ailments.

A character may attempt to heal another based on the current wound level of the injured person. Only one _healing_ skill attempt may be made per day on a particular individual. A successful roll indicates that the injured or sick character heals one wound level (5 wounds to 4 wounds, 4 wounds to 3 wounds, and so on) if using the wound damage system, or 2D body points if using the body point damage system.

Current Wound Level of Victim            | Difficulty
---------------------------------------- | ----------
1 wound/75-100% of body points remaining | Very Easy
2 wounds/50-74% of body points remaining | Easy
3 wounds/25-50% of body points remaining | Moderate
4 wounds/1-25% of body points remaining  | Difficult
5 wounds/0 body points                   | Very Difficult
