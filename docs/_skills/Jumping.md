__Time Required:__ 5 seconds

__Description:__ The _jumping_ skill covers leaps in horizontal and/or vertical directions. The difficulty is determined by the distance jumped +5 for each meter horizontally and +10 for each meter vertically. If, for example, a character wanted to leap two meters forward and one meter upward, the total difficulty would be 20 (5+5+10=20).
