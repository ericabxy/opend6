__Based On:__ Perception, Acumen

Know-how is reserved for performing basic tasks with no particular specialization or perfection, hence "basic", "not fancy" and "utilitarian". It is described as a "catch-all" skill which could mean its meant to generally
cover a character's mundane abilities, or is meant to govern specific everyday tasks as specializations.

The Perception attribute that governs this skill is known as the alternate name Acumen in _D6 Fantasy_.
