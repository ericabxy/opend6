__Description__ Libraries and databases contain vast stores of information that may prove helpful or at least relevant to a character's goals. The difficulty of a skill attempt depends on the complexity and obscurity of the information sought as well as the size and accuracy of the library/database (beginning with a difficulty of zero).

Complexity of Subject                              | Difficulty Modifier
-------------------------------------------------- | -------------------
General knowledge                                  | +0
Introductory theories                              | +5
Advanced/state-of-the-art/cutting-edge information | +10

Obscurity of Subject | Difficulty Modifier
-------------------- | -------------------
Common               | +0
Uncommon             | +5
Esoteric             | +10

Library               | Difficulty Modifier
--------------------- | -------------------
Catalogued, large     | +0
Catalogued, small     | +5
Not catalogued, large | +10
Not catalogued, small | +15

> **_Example:_** A character wants to find information regarding the replication of cells in super-heated conditions. In this game world, this topic is considered uncommon (+5) and cutting edge (+10) and the character only has access to a small, catalogued database (+5). The total difficulty for his attempt, therefore, is 20 (5+10+5=20).
