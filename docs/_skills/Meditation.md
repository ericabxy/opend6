__Time Required:__ 10 minutes

__Description:__ As many sages, philosophers, and psychiatrists have learned, the focusing of the mind can release formidable power within a person. This skill allows a character to temporarily increase any one skill die code for a number of minutes equal to a 1D roll. The difficulty is determined by the amount of increase at the rate of +5 for each pip. For example, a character who wants to raise his _dodge_ skill by 1D has a difficulty of 15 (5+5+5=15, since 1D=3 pips). If the character fails the roll, he gets the bonus indicated by his die roll.

> ___Example:__ A character needs a 15 to increase his _dodge_ skill by 1D. He makes a _meditation_ roll and generates a total of 12, not enough to receive the 1D bonus. The 12, however, is high enough to beat the next lowest bonus level (+2 pips), so the character's _dodge_ increases by two pips for 1D minutes. He rolls 1D and gets a 5, so the bonus lasts for five minutes.
