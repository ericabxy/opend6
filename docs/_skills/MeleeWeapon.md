__Description:__ <q>Characters who engage in close-quarters combat may wish to have the ability to wield a weapon, rather than relying solely on a weaponless fighting style (see below). As a character becomes more proficient in the use of a particular weapon, she increases her accuracy---e1ther in striking or in pin-pointing the most vulnerable area of her opponent. Since each type of weapon requires different knowledge and muscle control, a character cannot apply her experience in one weapon to another. For example, a character highly skilled in the use of a sword (die code of 7D+2) may have only a limited knowledge of axes (die code of 4D+1) and absolutely no experience in club (default to Reflexes die code of 3D+2).</q>
