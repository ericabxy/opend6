__Time Required:__ 5 seconds

__Description:__ Characters who engage in long-range combat may wish to increase their proficiency with missile weapons (bows, blowguns, pistols, rifles, blasters, flame-throwers, and so on).

Like the &lt;_melee weapon_&gt; skill, each type of weapon requires different knowledge and muscle control, and therefore a character cannot apply her experience in one weapon to another. For example, a character highly skilled in the use of a rifle (die code of 8D+1) may have only limited knowledge of pistols (die code 5D+2) and absolutely no experience in blowgun (default to Coordination die code of 4D).
