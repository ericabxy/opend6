__Description:__ _Navigation_ measures a character's ability to plot a safe course through a body of water or through space. Failure means that the pilot of the vessel must make a piloting skill check against a difficulty one level higher than the difficulty of the area. Success means the pilot need not make a roll (unless he performs an unexpected maneuver); the vessel arrives safely.

Danger Level of Area                      | Difficulty
----------------------------------------- | ----------
Completely safe; navigable lanes marked   | Very Easy
Relatively safe; few obstacles            | Easy
Narrow safe-lane                          | Moderate
Many obstructions                         | Difficult
Many moving obstructions (e.g. asteroids) | Very Difficult
