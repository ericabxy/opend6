__Time Required:__ 5 seconds

__Description:__ This skill enables characters to shroud their movements from the sight and hearing of others, including everything from hand gestures to their entire bodies. The _sneak_ roll total becomes the difficulty required for another character to perceive the sneaking character (usually through a Perception roll).
