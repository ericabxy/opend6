__Time Required:__ 5 seconds

__Description:__ A character must make a _piloting_ roll whenever he attempts to perform a stunt (see the "Vehicle Combat" chapter). Piloting a vehicle under normal circumstances does not require a roll. Types of vessels include starships, boats, hovercraft, and cars, trucks, and motorcycles (in which case the skill can be called driving).

__Examples:__ _car piloting_ (driving, p. 28), _hoverbike piloting_ (pp. 55, 78), _starfighter piloting_ (p. 73), _starship piloting_ (p. 6).
