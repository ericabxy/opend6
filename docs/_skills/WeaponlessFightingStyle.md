__Description:__ Three standard forms of weaponless fighting exist in the known world: martial arts, wrestling, and brawling.

Martial arts, the fighting art of the ancients, canters on a person's innate ability to control her muscles in such a way as to create great power in her strikes. Characters practicing a martial art employ a variety of moves, from frontal strikes directed at the solar plexus to spinning, high kicks to the head.

Wrestling has arisen out of a desire to disable an opponent without causing too much physical harm. Though some have strayed away from this ideal, most who practice wrestling focus on grappling their adversary and physically inhibiting his movements.

Brawling, the least formulaic of the three, includes the typical tavern-fight tactics---from wild haymaker punches to kicks targeted at an opponent's shins (or other, more fragile areas). Most characters that choose a weaponless fighting style will usually learn brawling, the easiest of the three to master.
